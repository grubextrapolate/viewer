building viewer:
----------------

simply typing 'make' should build the program. this uses a roughly
hacked together script called 'glcc' that i've used to compile opengl
applications on several architectures here at the university of
minnesota. at some point i'll probably move to a solution involving
autoconf, but this was the easiest.

usage:
------

viewer [basename]
       will read basename-l.ppm and basename-r.ppm as left and right
images
       and will write basename-leftcrop.ppm, basename-rightcrop.ppm,
       and basename-pair.ppm
viewer [options]
       -i leftinfile.ppm rightinfile.ppm
       -v fullinfile.ppm
       -o fulloutfile.ppm [default = fullout.ppm]
       -l leftoutfile.ppm [default = leftout.ppm]
       -r rightoutfile.ppm [default = rightout.ppm]

must contain either the -i or -v options or only basename.
if the -o, -l, or -r options are omitted default will be used

commands within program:
cursor keys             move left image by 1 pixel
cursor keys+shift       move right image by 1 pixel
cursor keys+alt         move both images by 1 pixel
cursor keys+ctrl        move left image by 10 pixels
cursor keys+shift+ctrl  move right image by 10 pixels
cursor keys+shift+alt   move both images by 10 pixels
esc or q                quit
enter                   write images

enter+shift             write images and quit


program execution examples:
---------------------------

	viewer pair0611b

will read pair0611b-l.ppm as the left image and pair0611b-r.ppm as the
right image. when the image is cropped (by pressing enter) the files
pair0611b-leftcrop.ppm, pair0611b-rightcrop.ppm, and pair0611b-pair.ppm
will be written.

	viewer -i pair0611b-l.ppm pair0611b-r.ppm

is equivalent to the above command in that it will read the same two
files, however the default output filenames will be leftout.ppm,
rightout.ppm, and fullout.ppm rather than the above.

	viewer -i pair0611b-l.ppm pair0611b-r.ppm -l cropleft.ppm \
               -r cropright.ppm -o stereoimage.ppm

this again reads the same two images, however rather than using the
default output filenames it will write the cropped and stereo images to
the specified filenames. if any of the output options are omitted the
default will be used.

	viewer -v pair0611b-pair.ppm

this will simply allow you to view the cropped and aligned stereo pair
which was created in the first example above.
